I've googled around and can't find anything about this at all. I opened WPS office for the first time, which came pre-installed on my laptop, on accident today. In doing that, it seems to have converted literally every single one of my regular, usable PDFs into "WPS PDFs" that I can only open in WPS and can only convert to a MS .doc or .docx file instead of back into a normal PDF (the option for PDF/"save as" is there Microsoft Word (часто — MS Word, WinWord или просто Word) — текстовый процессор, предназначенный для создания, просмотра и редактирования текстовых документов, с локальным применением простейших форм. Hello /r/SuggestALaptop (https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop) I am an incoming PhD student, who will move to Montreal on Fall. I am planning to buy a new laptop, preferably a lightweight one for daily use and casual gaming, which I will probably only use heavily this year because I also plan to buy a desktop (for gaming) once I have settled in my new place. Total budget and country of purchase: 800k-1.3M KRW (about 800-1100 USD). Can probably stretch · Ответы с готовыми решениями: При печати и при конвертации в pdf текст страниц съезжает. 
Yesterday my boss replaced my old Lenovo X200 laptop with an X1C - and I fell in love with that thing. The keyboard is fantastic, the trackpad is way better than the one in my Dell Precision 7510 (great finish), the screen is gorgous and it's super light. My mom does a lot of university work (nothing beyond MS Office, PDFs and YouTube). Thing is, she got her laptop around the same time I got my beloved I7 920 rig (it's an I3 380M, if I remember correctly), so around 7\~ years В отличие от Майкрософт Ворд скачать бесплатно можно только Word Viewer.

''' > Every computer I've found a virus on was either relying on Windows Defender or McAfee. And it was used by the average person. Not that it's their fault but they are the attack vector. In my experience, an ad blocker + effective email spam mitigation do more to "fix the user" than antivirus. I still recommend anti-malware software but the mitigation difference is marginal between expensive and low cost solutions like Defender. AV is a good first line of defense but really sucks.

Looking for your thoughts on this Wasabi Mango UHD490 120Hz 4K 49" monitor. (Can't link to ebay) I'm looking to upgrade from my old dual 32" 1080p tv's to one large monitor that will be centered on my desk. My intended uses are part outlook/ms office/pdf productivity, part youtube/netflix video watching, and part casual gaming. I want the 4K for video watching, the 120 hz for gaming, and the large screen size for productivity/what i'm used to. This seems to fit the ticket

Dad's bday is coming up and I'm hoping to build him a new pc for everyday normal(email, ms office, pdfs, etc.) use and with cyber monday coming up I think its a great time to buy parts. Needs to have a minimum of 20" monitor. No need for mouse or keyboard. I have a copy of win7 professional. I'm located in Maryland and have access to a Microcenter. Not looking to spend all the budget as but will do if needed. Thanks. We have been really lucky so far. I came in this morning to our first cryptolocker infection. Thanks to this sub, we had a canary kick off. However, it only kicked off by coincidence. Luckily, the user who kicked it off was fairly low level and had been the recipient of an access audit only a couple of months ago. Also, it looks like he actually followed the instructions in the canary email (shut the workstation off). This kept the fallout lower than expected. His boss however I was thinking of getting a surface pro 4 for school, so i would just be using it for onenote, ms office, pdfs, reddit and youtube. I was thinking of getting the core m model because i think the things i would be doing wont need an i7. Should I spend an extra 100 dollars for the i5? Any opinions are great. 
Made a couple of posts here recently, new to the whole building pcs thing, especially building budget PCs. The person I'm building this rig for is mainly using it for internet surfing, emails, MYOB, MS-Office, pdf editing, etc. Pretty much all simultaneously. I think I may have gone a bit overboard, anyone have any suggestions on trimming the fat? (I was thinking MOBO, PSU, SSD, RAM, but I'm not really sure what to change exactly). If anyone could offer me advice, that'd be great. THANKS.

My laptop is about 1 year old, the specs are as a follows: I got the computer as part of a settlement with a insurance company, I'm not very tech savvy, but I guess it's a pretty good computer. I'm fairly happy with it, windows 7 has worked okay. BUT, every now and then I get these moments when I just want to kill microsoft. On Reddit everybody seems to love linux.

Hi, I live in Australia and have the option of getting (as a gift for someone else) a core m3 SP5 with 4GB ram + typecover for 00. Or spending 00 to get the i5/8GB model + typecover. The person who will use it needs it for: - Chrome browsing (10-15 tabs open at any one time) - light pdf editing/markup via drawboard and adobe reader - Use of word, excel etc (1-4 documents open at any one time) Given the above use cases, would the m3 processor and especially the 4GB of ram be suffici. If I try to open a PDF file (that I've created using the "Save as PDF" option in Google Chrome) on MS Office, I'm always prompted to choose a "text encoding" but it ends up never working; however, if I have a PDF file that I've created using the "Export As \> PDF" option in MS Office, it opens smoothly. Why does this happen? Is there any way to solve. 2 This catalog covers Amphenol MIL-C-5015 type connec-tors.
