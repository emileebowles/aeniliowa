Lost Games Well hello there. I reseted my pc and when it was done i Went in to the computer to download back Forza Horizon 4, and i Went in to library category and looked for it but could not find it. So i looked for it in the Microsoft store and it says i have to buy it again. But i started up Xbox in windows and all my achivments are still. My internet is pretty bad, so i'm not surprised when i'm playing and my game disconnects because my internet stops working every once in a while, but ever since i bought the game on PC last week i get "Lost connection to game server" at random times even when my internet is working properly, I don't play a lot of online games but i used to play Rainbow 6 Siege up until a month or so ago and i never had anything like this which makes me think that i have some problem related to Overwatch speci. So this is partly a rant and I'm obviously not in the right state of mind since I'm really frustrated lol. Capela was a liability - 6 points 3/10 field goal, he was having a hard time with those switches and MDA still gave him minutes in the final minutes of the game. Capela was shit on both ends Chris Paul was not hitting his shots - he was 0-6 from three and he wasn't able to hit those clutch shots that we badly needed Harden was a no-show in the fourth quarter - he only shot the ball three. 
The current games in development are Granblue Fantasy: Relink - an action RPG that I want to play right now https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2s16sJAtRg (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2s16sJAtRg) And Granblue Fantasy: Versus - 2D fighting game, in beta soon. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-rFJMMLysw (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-rFJMMLysw) amp#x200B; Do you think there will be a Dragalia Lost console release eventually. Which means we get more rest! amp#x200B; Fuckin' AWESOME. The Draymond Steph pick and roll was a deadly death lineup play that pretty much won them the championship in 2015. However teams figured it out and just put a better defender on Draymond so that you could switch the pick and roll and eliminate that play. The Rockets have been playing switch defense for years now, specifically to counter the Warriors. If Steph beats you in isolation, so be it. But to go away from switch everything was a costly mistake. James Harden and Chris Paul showed.

Golden State I feel like would still be okay because they got the talent to steal 2 games at Houston, Houston would be in nervous mode but not full panic since they have home court coming up, Boston would be okay, and Milwaukee would be in full on oh fuck panic mode. Philly would be scared but they could still protect home court. Toronto would probably be okay because they can win at Philly. Please tell me what t.v shows you're currently interested in so I can avoid. I know I have to write something here so it counts as a post but I don’t even know what else to say. There’s no mystical date or moment in the future that’s going to fix everything. The Celtics are 5-4 since the magical plane ride. The playoffs are really the only thing with any chance of sparking any kind of run in this team. And I suppose that’s all that matters. But I’m concerned that way back in the early portion of the season the Celtics’ star player gave this team a very generous deadlin.
